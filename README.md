# android-ForegroundService
This is my practice project of how to maintain life of Bound Service running on Foreground.
The app can say hello if the service is start on foreground.

So far its work, but haven't try if there is a running Thread in the service. 

### How to import:
Open Android Studio, click Import Project, select build.gradle file in root folder

> Check TODOs. 
> Correction and comments are welcome. I'm still learning to implement Service in Android.
